## LED Blink Patterns

When initially powered on, the system will attempt to establish a GNSS fix and synchronize the real-time clock (RTC) for up to 2 minutes. During this time, the LED will blink every second. Once the RTC is synchronized, the system will set an alarm to wake at the user-specified time and then enter a low-power deep sleep. While the system is in deep sleep, the Watchdog Timer (WDT) will wake the system to check the program has not frozen approximately every 8 seconds. The LED will blink briefly (100 ms) during this time.
