## Step 6: Test Program Compilation
* Navigate to the /Software/Arduino/cryologger_aws folder of the downloaded repository
* Double-click on the `cryologger_aws.ino` file
* Click on the checkmark in the upper left corner of the Arduino IDE program window
* Watch debugging window for compilation errors
